    <h3>Imeck15 Per-Image Click Settings Guide</h3>
    <p>
        This guide explains how to configure click actions when a registered image is found. It is primarily intended for automating operations in windowed applications.
    </p>

    <h4>1. How to Register Images for Clicking</h4>
    <p>
        First, register the image that will serve as the click target. Using the "Capture Image" function is the basic method.<br>
        <b>Tip:</b> It is recommended to capture <b>small parts</b> like buttons or icons as the target.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Reason 1: Faster Processing</b><br>Searching for a small image is less demanding on the PC than searching the entire screen.</li>
        <li><b>Reason 2: Accurate Clicking</b><br>Even if multiple identical buttons exist on the screen, capturing only a specific part allows for precise clicking on the intended target.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. How to Control Click Order (Interval Setting)</h4>
    <p>
        The "Interval" is the minimum waiting time (in seconds) after clicking an image before the <b>same image</b> can be clicked again.
    </p>
    <div class="important">
        <b>[Important] Click Priority Mechanism</b><br>
        If multiple clickable images are found on the screen during monitoring, Imeck15 prioritizes clicking the one with the <b>shortest "Interval" setting</b> and does not click other images. Use this mechanism to control the click sequence.
    </div>

    <h4>3. Technique for Clicking Multiple Locations on One Screen</h4>
    <p>
        By applying the "Interval Setting" mechanism, you can make it click multiple locations sequentially on a single screen.<br>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> The image or text at the clicked location must change (disappear, gray out, etc.) after being clicked.
    </p>
    <p><b>Example Setup Steps:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Register parts A, B, and C that you want to click on the screen as separate images.</li>
        <li>Set shorter interval times for images you want to click earlier. (e.g., A: <code>1.5</code> sec, B: <code>2.0</code> sec, C: <code>2.5</code> sec)</li>
        <li>Start monitoring. First, <b>part A</b> with the shortest interval will be clicked.</li>
        <li>After clicking, if part A disappears from the screen, <b>part B</b> will become the next click target in the subsequent monitoring cycle.</li>
        <li>Similarly, <b>part C</b> will be clicked last.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>4. How to Adjust Recognition Accuracy and Range</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Recognition Threshold:</b><br>This setting determines how similar images need to be to be considered a "match". A value around <code>0.8</code> is usually sufficient, but setting it to <code>0.9</code> or higher can be effective for strictly distinguishing minor differences like text variations.</li>
        <li><b>Search Range (ROI Setting):</b><br>Enabling "ROI Enabled" limits the search target to a <b>200x200 pixel area</b> centered around the click coordinate. This significantly speeds up processing and greatly reduces the load on the PC. (Variable ROI mode allows setting the range freely).</li>
        <li><b>ROI Range Specification:</b><br>Instead of a 200x200 range centered on the click position, this feature allows you to specify a specific area to focus on and designate a separate click position.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. "Debounce" Setting for Special Situations</h4>
    <p>
        "Debounce" is used for complex operations like "click image A with a short interval, then click another image B, and after a short pause, click image A again to proceed to the next screen."
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Mechanism:</b> Setting a debounce time extends the waiting period for the second click to <b>"Interval + Debounce Time"</b> when the same image is targeted consecutively. This creates an opportunity for other images to be clicked first.
